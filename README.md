# DSA Homework 03 â€“ Pathfinding Visualization

This project includes two tasks:

- **Task 01**: Simple A-to-B animation on a clear grid.
- **Task 02**: Dijkstra pathfinding with walls (`#`) and animated movement from `A` to `B` using `X`.

Input is 1-based. Wall positions are fixed, and START/END cannot be placed on them.
